# MiniRPG
This is a Miniature RPG built in Unity. It has a fixed area in which you may move around. There are currently a couple of interactable items you may pick up and drop, and an inventory of fixed size.

Environment was constructed using a combination of assets from http://devassets.com/ and self-made ones from Blender/Unity.

Upcoming plans for improvement:

- Add equipment uniqueness (graphics, equipability)
- Add additional player animations (combat)
- Add enemies with individualized graphics, animations, and pathing
- Add additional player properties (health, stats, regeneration, experience)
